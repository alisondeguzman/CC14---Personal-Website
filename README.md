What features you implemented. 
- I mostly just implemented button features tomake my website more interactive. In the homepage, I implemented a functional button that leads the user to the "about" page when clicked. Meanwhile, in the "about" page, I added buttons that aloows the users to browse through my different artworks per category. Lastly, in the "contact" page, I added links to the social media icons that redirects the users to that page when clicked. 

Any additional design choices or deviations from the wireframe (with justification)
- I tried to stick with my original wireframe and prototype, though I did do minor changes in the design. First, I decided to make the pink rectangle in the nav bar to be bigger than the one in the original design to maximize the white space, and i have decided to make the green rectangle border to be rounded on both sides to match my theming. In the homepage, I slightly changed the design of the button to make it more minimalistic and on-theme. As for the "About" page, I added the buttons directly on top of the images instead of it being below the pictures-- to be able to easily spot it. Lastly, in general, I changed the fonts used in the entire website. I wanted something that is easier to read and clean-looking.
